# Quantum Error Mitigation: from theory to practice

**Venue**: QuSoft Seminar (Amsterdam, NL)

**Date**: Feb 7, 2025

## Abstract

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) provides a set of techniques to reduce the impact of noise in near-term quantum computers without the large qubit overhead of quantum error correction.
In this talk, I will introduce the core ideas behind QEM and detail the differences from error correction.
I will discuss theoretical results that constrain the effective use of QEM techniques in practice, considering both sampling requirements and the role of new classical algorithms for noisy circuit simulation.
From there, we will explore the future of QEM as hardware improves and error-corrected devices come online.
Along the way, I will cover three QEM techniques—zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), and virtual distillation—highlighting their trade-offs and practical applications.
